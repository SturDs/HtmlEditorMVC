# RichHtmlEditorMVC
This is a Rich HTML Editor in MVC Razor

It easy to use and custom as you like.

Just you need to write this below in your Razor file:
        @HelperExtensions.Word(Html, new myWordParam("MyHtmlData", Model.MyHtmlData, "100%", "400px"))

I used HelperExtensions to create:
        public static MvcHtmlString Word(this HtmlHelper html, myWordParam oWord)
        {
            return html.Partial("~/Views/Shared/_Word.cshtml", oWord);
        }
        
The Editor in HTML with few buttons are in "_Word.cshtml".

...and here is how to get it on your Controller:

        [HttpPost]
        [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
        public async Task<ActionResult> Create(Titolo titolo)
        {
            ViewBag.ToDo = "Create";

            //--- Content of the HTML Editor we have created in this tutorial
            string contentOfHTMLEditor = titolo.MyHtmlData;

            return View(titolo);
        }
